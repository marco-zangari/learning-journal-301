I learned today to do a lot of stuff. What does that mean? Well, I worked through the pair programming with one person to make it through the day three's lab. We did not make it to the end, but we were able to learn a lot about how really &$^%&^% git and consequently github can become.

Code review and lecture were helpful and laying in new material, like Handlebars, is all good. New stuff! More tools!

Took a crack at another lab, which went far more smoothly, than the one in the morning. And there was enough energy to then get to work on my portfolio. Was able to get the constructor function to work. I had to refactor it so that the values were right. That was cool because only really in javascript could something not throw an error and yet not work. Not.One.Error. And yet still not work. Ok. Sure.
