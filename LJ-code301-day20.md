Today I learned that it was a relief to have a really good team to work with. It was especially rewarding to produce a project that we could be proud of. I mean this kind of a project, with a natural language processor API, was exactly the kind of thing that drew me away from academics and toward the tech shop. There is so much to do in the tech world with these kinds of tools. The amount of exploration seems limitless.

While we couldn't produce an application with great sophistication, we produced a really strong proof of concept.

I'm looking forward to the next steps.
