Brutal lab today. Made some headway on IIFEs and recognizing why the variable at the top of the page stays var instead of let or const. I think it has something to do with being able to be reassigned from file to file. However, code review of the lab was straight up hard because I had not understood the code base as well as I would have liked and had made very little headway in all of the TODOs.

Functional programming is still a bit of a mystery though I will not soon forget that functional programming avoids changing the state of arrays while allowing for manipulation. Thank the stars for code review!

Finally made time to work on the portfolio. It had been a few days as the labs had taken up a lot of time.

Stayed late today to go through the pages methods and to get familiar with the code base for tomorrow's lab.

Yeah for project week almost upon us! Looking forward to it!
