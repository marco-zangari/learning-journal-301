Today I learned how to get a burger to toggle. First I made it show. Then I made it hide. Instead of having it show and hide on click, which was making it do - at least visibly nothing because the computer was performing what I was telling it to do but it was imperceptible, I switched the method to toggle. Toggle worked nearly how I want it to work.

I learned a little about binary and hex. That was pretty cool. David and Brian were having an ascii conversation that turned into a binary one. There is a way to turn binary into hex using your hands that I would like to teach myself. Who knows when it would come in handy - that's a pun, a bad one, but one none the less.

The lab was great today. Really had a nice way of working through the docs, asking questions, working with my partner, and asking the TAs. It took longer than I think we would have liked, two and a half hours. But we were able to finish and complete the stretch goal. It was really good to see how backwards we did some of the TODOs and getting the stuff loaded. And yet nothing really broke.....that badly.

Tomorrow I'm going to tackle a few more features on the portfolio.
