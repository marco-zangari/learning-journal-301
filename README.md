# learning-journal-301
a daily accounting of my personal progression through code fellows 301. 

Here you will find all the reflections for each day of instruction, in Code Fellows, 301 course. Each day, over the course of a four week course, there will be an update on what has been learned and how I have been able to implement it into my work. The objective for this project should be for me, the writer / developer, to gain some critical perspective on what I have been doing and hopefully get better at both developing and writing...and maybe even thinking.
