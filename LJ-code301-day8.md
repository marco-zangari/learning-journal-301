That was the last line and only line of what I was going to write for my learning journal of yesterday. I cannot remember what interrupted the writing, however, it is a neat little artifact of the day.

Instead what I remember a day on is that what happened during the lecture was pretty hazy. I was trying without success to not think about code wars problems and my portfolio, to refactor to get the storage and api calls working.
