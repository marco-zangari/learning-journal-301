#Day 16

Today I learned that integrating an API into one's program is a challenge. Each one is its own version of idiosyncratic ticks, buried in documentation, written too quickly. Alas.

The team worked well together overall. We had hoped to have a working, though entirely ugly, user experience: a search box and Reddit results of words, but we were not able to do that. By tomorrow, we should have what we need.

Looking forward to solidifying what the backend actually is and how it communicates with the frontend. Or better still, I look forward to connecting the backend to the front and the front to the back with real facility before the week is out. YES!
