Today I pushed my portfolio forward ever so slightly. I'll catch up with the assignments from yesterday and today so that I will almost be caught up. The page will still look like dung but its functionality might be entirely there as per the requirements.

I've fallen behind with the CodeWars. I'm going to have to push to get those done before the weekend. And get my score beyond where it is.

I've tried to keep the sense the acronyms and the concepts and the applications of the concepts straight all week....I know it's Tuesday, but it feels like it's Thursday. The week for some reason really sped up.

Looking forward to working with the project team this week. I'm excited to see what we come up with: the Game of Thrones Ancestry Finder, Rainier Watch features build-outs, The Conversation App from Reddit, Prank Pusher (auto-jokes via cellphone), or something we don't know yet.
