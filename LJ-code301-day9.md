Well, that was a weird morning. First it was fun to sit closer to the front, as we had changed the room. It gave an opportunity to experiment.

The grocery store project was fun to build from scratch. I had sort of resolved myself to thinking through the logic of the TODOs. My thinking was that they were realistically a part of the dev experience. To model what a day might look like was important. I could also see how doing something from scratch is important, as we did with the grocery store project.

In terms of learning, I felt like I cannot see how the back and front talk to each other yet. It's not making sense. I mean I know that the back and front don't talk until I make them communicate. The request response cycle of get, put, post, and delete is still really hazy.

I did like Nick's explanation of his own working practice, to toggle between the different sheets so as to negotiate the back and front.
