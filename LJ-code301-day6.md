Today I learned how to, or at least was able to, implement handlebars into my portfolio project. That was really great since I had not been able to do it before today. And even more importantly it was what I had planned to do today.

Sadly I was not able to work on it more since the lab that we needed to hand in, lab 05, took much longer than expected. And we were not able to turn it before we were well within striking distance of lecture. In retrospect it would have been better to knock out the lab after Friday's lecture, but at the time, Friday afternoon, I wanted nothing more than get out of the building.

So with that experience, my new partner and I finished the lab 06.

Still not working with git and github to my liking. The work flow got slightly better as this weekend I dove into the docs, or at least the help docs, in git to understand better the fast forward features. I also finally did the fetch feature within the lab flow, i.e. it is one of the directions in the work flow when the initial driver and navigator switch places. I have a feeling that may have contributed to why when I worked on lab 04 the branches got so wonky.
