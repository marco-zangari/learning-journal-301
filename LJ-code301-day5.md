It was a good morning to talk through the portfolio. I was able to refactor my constructor function and the template feature. It is still not done because the listeners are not yet there, but code review and to a certain extent the lecture at the end of the day went far in making the week's concepts more tangible. The weekend is going to be long.

Glad that a number of people confirmed that they will show up for mob code wars. It would be great to have it be a regular feature of the next couple of Saturdays if only for an hour or two. I'm about to poke into the higher levels to see what might be worthwhile to do tomorrow, just in case we need a few suggestions of what to work on.

Looking forward to carving out a little time in the next week to get to a meet-up or two. And thinking about what a final project might look like.
