Today I feel like a made incremental improvement to understand what is going on between the front and the back. The whole stack is still strange. However, I think the request response cycle is seeping in.

It was especially fun to work with a person for more than one day. It was nice to be able to find a rhythm even if it was for only day while 'pear'-programming.

I appreciated the presentation that was held about UX too. The ideas were pretty basic. But the presentation did get me thinking about user expectations and how developers might manage those expectations so that the products can still do unexpected things.
