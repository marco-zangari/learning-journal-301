Today I learned how to do a somewhat involved refactor. We had to break up a function that was pretty hairy and make sure that the call backs, built into another function, would not entirely break. It was really great to work through on paper, by design, how something would work and then sequentially work through the process. It was really great. In general, this project week was about taking more time to investigate how to do something then quickly implementing than implementing directly from notes taken in class. There was more research involved with the acquisition of libraries and APIs. It was difficult, yes, and it also felt more like what a more advanced project, and more production like project, would look like.
