Today I learned that you can get stuff done, make progress, and not feel like you've made progress.

We were able to: hook up the APIs; get them to talk to each other; make and unmake and make and unmake the codebase to allow for our functions to work (basics like that...); struggle through Handlebars and make the template do something that we did not implement previously (though it was demonstrated in a class a week ago perhaps); got a word cloud working; decided on what the overall look of the application should be; and in general saw the project have its final shape more or less. And I think I understand what a callback function does - rather than simply patterning it off some model code, cut and paste! - after going through each and every call back in our code to see which functions are aligned with which function.

It did not feel like progress was made because the project itself looks awful. It is neither mobile first nor web first. Now in some ways we have working in our favor that Reddit is our main provider of information and the design of Reddit is - at least from my perspective - awful. However, it does provide a template and expectation. So there is that.

Anyhoo, I'm looking forward to a big day, day four in project week, to get the app to look more like something.
