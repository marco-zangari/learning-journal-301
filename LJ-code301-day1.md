What I learned today, was that each and every start to a class is its own beast.

At any rate, the day was awkward since it is a new start. And because it is a new start I really had no idea what I was doing. I was very much winging it today. My pace was really bad.

The code wars challenge was simple enough once I realized that it was a syntax question that they were after and that really a simple jaunt through MDN was going to produce an answer to removing the dots and adding dashes. The real challenge was getting my head into CodeWars, i.e. to pass the quick test. I was staring at the screen for an uncomfortably long time. I had to leave the table and take a walk around the floor before I was able to get my head right to answer the JavaScript entrance exam. My brain even after a few days had become unaccustomed.

Indeed that was the order of the day. Git commands. Off. Making a constructor function. Off. It was all slightly off.
